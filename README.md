# TheMass
1. Our Vision
$Themass, An decentralized, deflationary Defi token that automatically reward BNB. The
innovative buyback mechanism and community-driven base guarantees the
long-term benefits of holders.
2. Introduction
Themass Whitepaper aims to educate readers on our vision, strategy and roadmap. Below
we illustrate in detail our unique mechanism. The reward redistribution concept was
firstly held by Safemoon, and then HODL, Ghostface has made it BNB redistribution and
website claimable, now $Themass has integrated and made it even further to
automatically reward direct to holders' address for our holders having passive income
without any effort.
What's innovative is that $Themass improve the anti-dump whale pool mechanism, which
includes not only the BuyBack but also a series of planned pump strategies when the
pool is filled. In other words, more transactions, the higher the price. There will be a visual
chart that tells holders when will the pump happen, holders will know the exact timing of
price pump, the solid price increasing estimation will stimulate more and more holders to
buy more, which is NEVER DUMP and ONLY PUMP!
3. Tokenomic
1. NEVER DUMP, ONLY PUMP
6% bnb of each transaction is fueled into the whale pool for buy back and burnThe whale pool has two functions:
 If the currency price drops by 5%, Whale Pool will automatically start, and the
contract will use 1% bnb of Whale Pool to buy back tokens and destroy them.
 A series of huge pump buyback when the pool is filled:
i. When the whale pool is filled with 500bnb, it will automatically use 20% to buy
back and destroy to enter the black hole.
ii. The whale pool is filled with 1000bnb, use 25% repurchase and destroy to break
into the black hole
iii. The whale pool is filled with 2000bnb, use 30% repurchase and destroy to
break into the black hole
iv. The whale pool is filled with 5000bnb, using 35% repurchase and destruction to
break into the black hole
v. The whale pool is filled with 10000bnb, using 40% repurchase and destruction
to break into the black hole
(I-iv can only be triggered once. Except for the last one, the last one can be
triggered indefinitely, and it will be triggered again every time the whale pool filled
with 10000bnb)
2. HODL TO EARN
4% of each transaction is collected and distributed to the holders according to the
proportion of the holdings, and the holdings of the holdings will pay dividends bnb. It is
automatically distributed to currency holders every 4 hours.
Special improvements:
 The top 10 coin holding addresses do not participate in dividends. (Including team
allocation).
 Holders of less than 1 million will not participate in dividends.
3. 4% of each transaction is automatically fuel into the liquidity pool
